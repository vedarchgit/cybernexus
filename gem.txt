  Over the past several interactions, we transformed the CyberNexus project from a conceptual plan into a functional
  full-stack application.

   1. Backend Development (FastAPI): We started with a skeleton Python backend and replaced its in-memory list with a robust
      MariaDB database connection. We then added core features, including a dynamic search endpoint to filter threats and a
      security audit trail to log new submissions.
   2. Containerization (Docker): To make the backend and database easy to manage, we containerized them. I created a
      Dockerfile for the FastAPI application and a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate both the backend and MariaDB
      containers, enabling a one-command startup.
   3. Frontend Setup (React + TailwindCSS): We configured the existing React frontend to use TailwindCSS. After resolving
      several environment and permission issues with npm, we successfully installed the necessary dependencies and created
      the configuration files.
   4. UI Development: Finally, I replaced the boilerplate React code with a complete, functional user interface. This UI,
      styled with TailwindCSS, provides a form to submit new threats, a search bar to filter the threat feed, and a
      real-time display of data fetched from the backend API.
