Perfect. Here’s what your stack looks like and an actionable roadmap for your project using React, FastAPI/Node.js, MariaDB, starting locally, then moving to Docker, and using GitHub for collaboration:

Recommended Stack & Flow
Frontend:
React (easy modern UI, form validation, fetching API data, maps and dashboards)

Backend:
FastAPI (prefer for Python + async support + docs)
or
Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript option; either Express or Fastify)

Database:
MariaDB (start local for rapid prototyping; move to Docker for production/final demo or easy deployment)

Version Control:
GitHub (public or private repo for code, issues, documentation, CI/CD)

Basic Roadmap
Setup

Initialize React project (Vite, Create React App, or Next.js as preferred)

Initialize FastAPI (or Node.js) backend project

Install and configure local MariaDB (or use a cloud trial for early development)

Connect backend to MariaDB (test simple CRUD with a “report”/“queue”/“inventory” table)

Develop Core Features

Backend: Build REST API endpoints (create/read) for core data (disease reports, queue entries, etc.)

Frontend: Build forms to submit data, pages to visualize lists/maps/charts

Test connection: React fetches actual data from backend, displays on UI

Local MVP Demo

End-to-end submission and retrieval working

Ready for testing, screenshots, and feedback

Dockerize (Growth Step)

Add Dockerfile for backend, compose file for database, and/or frontend

Test bringing up stack with docker-compose up, ensuring network links work

Polish & Collaborate

Use GitHub for versioning, PRs, collaboration

Add README, usage docs, and contribution steps

Optional: setup live preview (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Railway for backend if time allows)

Resources You’ll Need
Docs for FastAPI: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

MariaDB setup for local/dev: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/getting-started-with-mariadb/

React & Docker quickstart guides (many on YouTube and the official docs)

Example full stack repo:

https://github.com/coding-to-music/full-stack-react-fastapi-postgresql (can swap PostgreSQL for MariaDB easily)

Try/learn: Start with just POST/GET data; only make it fancy with maps, clustering, notifications once basic data flows work.

You can add real security and basic cybersecurity features to your project in practical ways—even if the project is focused on healthcare or civic data, not “security” as its core. Here’s how:

1. Secure Data Handling
Use HTTPS for all client-server and server-database communication (start with local self-signed certs or trusted reverse proxy).

Sanitize all incoming data (use libraries like pydantic in FastAPI for input validation).

Escape queries and use parameterized SQL to prevent injection attacks.

2. User Privacy and Data Protection
Implement simple role-based access (e.g., admins vs. regular users); use JWT or session tokens for auth.

For health apps, never store sensitive identifiers (names, phone numbers); store only anonymized info or encrypted tokens.

Mask/obscure user data on export or map (e.g., show only general area, not precise address).

3. Resilience to Common Attacks
Add rate-limiting or CAPTCHAs to public upload endpoints to prevent spam/bot abuse.

Limit file types and sizes for any uploads (e.g., images, PDFs), and check all user files with antivirus APIs if possible.

Log failed or suspicious login/API attempts for later analysis.

4. Database Security
Use strong passwords and non-default ports for your MariaDB (even in dev).

Grant minimal privileges to app database users; never allow direct database access from outside your backend.

5. Cybersecurity Awareness Features (Optional “Plus” Features)
In a medicine stock tracker: Add a “counterfeit report” feature, so users can anonymously flag suspicious medicines/pharmacies.

In crowd health: Add health data tampering/audit log—track every creation, edit, and deletion.

Show basic transparency: an “audit trail” of action logs for admin review.

6. Learning Value for You
Building with these elements gives you real, resume-worthy experience with web app and API security—a foundation for advanced cybersecurity roles.

Share your security choices in your final README or hackathon pitch to stand out!

Summary Table:

Security Element	Why/How
HTTPS	Protects all user data in transit
SQL injection prevention	Keeps database safe from hack attempts
Rate limiting, CAPTCHA	Blocks bots/spam, improves reliability
Anon. design & data mask	Guards privacy, builds public trust
Role-based authentication	Enables admin/user views, reduces risk
Logging & audit trail	Detects misuse, enables forensics
By weaving in these features, your project is not just a DB/web demo—it’s a real-world, user-ready, security-conscious application that’s relevant for both public health and cyber defense awareness.You can add practical security and cybersecurity features to your project regardless of domain. Here’s how:

How to “Involve Security and Cybersecurity” in Your Project
Data Encryption:
Use HTTPS for all client/backend/database traffic—even in testing.
Encrypt sensitive fields in MariaDB (e.g., patient ID tokens) and always hash passwords if you use accounts.

Authentication & Access Control:
Add simple JWT or OAuth2 token authentication to FastAPI; restrict routes for “admin” vs. “user” access.
Anonymize user submissions by default to follow privacy best practices.

Injection and Input Protection:
Use FastAPI’s validation (pydantic) to sanitize all incoming data; never accept raw SQL or user scripts.
For MariaDB, always use parameterized queries to block SQL injection attacks.

Logging & Audit Trail:
MariaDB (and your app) should keep non-personal logs of all access, failed logins, and major actions.
Add an “admin-only” dashboard to review these for tamper detection.

Bot/Spam Defense:
Integrate basic CAPTCHAs and rate-limiting on public APIs and forms to stop bots or brute-force attacks.

File Safety:
Limit file uploads to safe types/sizes. Reject anything suspicious; scan via API if available.

User Safety & Transparency:
Show users when, why, and how you use or store their data.
Provide a “report” button for abuse/spam/breach (teaches cyber hygiene).

Even in public health, these are essential:
You help users, clinics, or communities trust the project, protect privacy, stop spam/abuse, and practice real-world web/app security.

If you want a simple code sample for any of these (auth, validation, logging, DB security, etc.), let me know your preferred language and I’ll give you a base!
